Trend deviation analysis (TDA)

Identify correlation networks in microarray/counts data for expression or DNA methylation microarrays in GEO to compute a global signature for coexpression/comethylation.
For a given experiment, construct the correlation network and compare the DE/DM genes to correlations to that of the global signature to identify genes that have a change in the correlation structure.
